						<p>This homework assignment has been very interesting. I did most of the requirements for the homework for the first two days and I thought "That wasn't so bad!". And then I went to office hours. Couple of hours later, I was in the middle of "it works but I don't know why" and "it is broken but I don't know why".</p>
						<p>But I did not give up. It was not an easy journey. It was a series of debugging and deleting everything because the approaches just were not quite right. I am still in the middle of this assignment and it is roughtly 11 hours before it is due so I'd better get to it. Wish me luck! </p>
